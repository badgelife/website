# Welcome to BadgeLife!
Welcome to **BadgeLife**, the home for the #Badgelife community! Here we will be hosting things like [Badge Archive](/archive/archive), the upcoming Badge.life API, and more. Currently it's mainly the home for our Badgelife Community (aka Village) Schedule.

## Village / Community Schedule:
All events listed here take place in the community/village unless specified **CREATOR STAGE or COMMUNITY STAGE**. Note that "Community Stage" is confusingly **NOT** located in our community/village! It is near the village at **Exhibition Hall W 4 C105** on the map, near several communities and is labeled

Please be sure to thank our 2025 Community Sponsors at the bottom of this page! They really came through and are helping us fund both this year and years to come!
