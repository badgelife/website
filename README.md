To collaborate you wither need to be added as a repository collaborator, or you need to fork the project.

### Contributing as a Repository Collaborator

- make your changes
- test locally
- push to your branch on github
- open a pull request
- ping moderators if not addressed in a timely manner

### Contributing as a Non-Collaborator

- ping moderators if not addressed in a timely manner
